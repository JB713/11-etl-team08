ETL Project Topic: Video Game Sales, Stock Prices, and Ratings

Purpose: To create a database via SQL combining video game sales, video game Metacritic scores, and video game platform historical stock data.

Dependencies: For the project to work we need to extract the video games sales, scores, and stock info. Transform a csv file, json file, and API connection to create the database. The database be mapped out using set keywords.  The target mapping needs to draw out accurately to map out the games to their belonging companies, companies to their stock history of when the games were published, and their Metacritic scores at the time. 

We will be using a SQL database because we are working with multiple data formats, relational databases, and foreign keys.

Data Sources:
